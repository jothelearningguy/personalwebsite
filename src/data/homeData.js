This partnership was instrumental in advancing Cognition\'s research, exploring what happens when you merge EEG technology with artificial intelligence. Carnegie Mellon provided critical research support and collaboration opportunities that helped shape our understanding of brain-computer interfaces and neural computation.' },

But here\'s the thing: I wasn\'t just there to study. I was there to build. While my peers were memorizing textbooks, I was already prototyping a non-invasive brain-computer interface. I graduated with honors in Biology, Neuroscience, and Chemistry, but more importantly, I left with the foundation to build at the intersection of biology and technology.' },

We\'re solving the fundamental forgetting crisis: people forget up to 70% of what they learn online within 24 hours. Cognition is the drop-in intelligence layer that transforms any software into a living system that converses, remembers, and reinforces growth across apps, devices, and time. We\'ve secured $150,000+ in funding and partnered with Google DeepMind, NVIDIA, and Carnegie Mellon. Looking ahead, we\'re pioneering non-invasive AI EEG brain-computer interfaces that will close the loop between biological learning processes and digital knowledge systems-making forgetting optional and learning effortless. Cognition is more than software; it\'s the cognitive infrastructure for humanity\'s next chapter.' },

I got moved up every year after that, steadily climbing through the ranks. In my final two years playing (sophomore and junior years of college), I played at the highest youth level in the United States-the Elite Clubs National League. This journey from recreational play to the pinnacle of youth soccer taught me about discipline, perseverance, continuous improvement, and what it takes to compete at the highest levels-lessons that have shaped my approach to building companies and leading teams.' },

This journey taught me about building teams, creating culture, establishing vision, and turning an idea into a reality. The lessons learned from founding and building Say Word FC-from recruiting players to establishing team identity to competing on the world stage-directly informed my approach to building companies and leading teams.' },
